Next-Step Order Book Implementation (Production Upgrade Outline)

Scope: Convert the temporary Supabase-only approach to a production-grade, low-latency, resilient architecture without changing existing core contracts.

1) Indexing & Ingestion
- Dedicated indexer service consuming OrderRouter events (OrderPlaced, OrderCancelled, OrderExecuted) and OrderBook library events if desired (OrderAdded, OrderRemoved).
- Backfill strategy: start from deployment block; periodic reconciliation jobs.
- Reorg safety: persist blockNumber, blockHash, txIndex; confirmation depth (e.g., 10-25 blocks) before finalizing.

2) Storage Model
- Primary: Postgres for truth (orders, trades, positions, order_events) with partitions per market_id and time-based partitioning for order_events.
- Caching tier (future): Redis for per-market depth (top N levels) and user order lists; write-through from event handlers.
- Analytics tier (future): ClickHouse for scalable time-series queries (trades, depth snapshots, metrics).

3) Real-time Distribution
- WebSocket or Pusher channels per market: publish snapshot-on-subscribe then incremental deltas (price level updates, trades).
- Rate limiting and coalescing of deltas; top-20/50/100 level feeds.

4) Snapshots & Recovery
- Periodic depth snapshots per market in durable storage (DB table or object storage).
- Fast cold-start: load latest snapshot + replay deltas since snapshot height.

5) API Layer (CQRS)
- Write side: ingestion/indexer only.
- Read side: REST for historical queries; WebSocket for live depth. Endpoints: /api/depth, /api/trades, /api/orders (user + market), /api/markets/summary.

6) Observability
- Structured logs with trace IDs, metrics for event lag, queue depth, publish latency, snapshot time.
- Alerts for staleness (no events), reorg spikes, API latency.

7) Security & Hardening
- Service role keys only on server; RLS policies for user reads; least-privilege for workers.
- Input validation and pagination caps; DoS protection on subscribe and query endpoints.

8) Testing & Verification
- Deterministic replay of event streams for book state; property tests comparing on-chain executions vs book state.
- Canary markets to validate indexer before enabling for all markets.

9) Rollout Plan
- Phase 1: Supabase persistence + event backfill + market query APIs.
- Phase 2: WebSocket deltas + snapshots; Redis cache.
- Phase 3: ClickHouse for analytics; advanced views (VWAP, liquidity metrics).

10) Operational Runbooks
- Backfill procedures, reorg handling, snapshot/restore, key rotation, emergency pause of publishers.

Notes
- Avoid contract changes; use configured addresses and environment variables.
- Ensure compatibility with thousands of markets via partitioning and horizontal workers.
