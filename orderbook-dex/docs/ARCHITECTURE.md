# OrderBook DEX Architecture

## Overview

This document provides a technical overview of the OrderBook DEX architecture for custom metrics trading.

## System Components

### 1. Smart Contract Layer

#### Core Contracts
- **MetricsMarketFactory**: Factory for creating new metric markets
- **CentralVault**: Secure asset custody and management
- **OrderRouter**: Order routing and P&L tracking
- **OrderBook**: Order matching engine for each metric

#### Supporting Contracts
- **GovernanceToken**: DEX governance token
- **OracleManager**: Oracle data aggregation and validation
- **FeeManager**: Fee calculation and distribution
- **EmergencyManager**: Emergency pause and recovery functions

### 2. Oracle Integration Layer

#### Primary Oracles
- **Chainlink**: Price feeds and external data
- **UMA**: Optimistic oracle for custom metrics
- **Band Protocol**: Cross-chain data aggregation

#### Data Validation
- Multi-source verification
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Fallback mechanisms

### 3. Security Layer

#### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (OpenZeppelin AccessControl)
- Multi-signature wallet integration
- Time-locked administrative functions

#### Circuit Breakers
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Position size limits
- Volatility-based trading halts

## Data Flow

```
User → Frontend → OrderRouter → OrderBook → Matching Engine
                      ↓
                 CentralVault ← → Trade Settlement
```

## Order Matching Algorithm

1. **Price-Time Priority**: Orders matched by best price, then timestamp
2. **Partial Fills**: Support for partial order execution
3. **Order Types**: Market, Limit, Stop, Iceberg orders
4. **Anti-Manipulation**: MEV protection and front-running prevention

## Scalability Solutions
