🔄 Key Differences from Bonding Curve System:
• Both long AND short positions affect price equally
• Traditional AMM-style pricing with net position impact
• Reduced base reserves (1 ETH vs 10,000 ETH)
• Simplified margin requirements
• No funding rates or complex bonding curves

💡 Price Impact Formula:
newPrice = basePrice * (1 + netPosition / baseReserves)
Where netPosition = totalLongs - totalShorts

📊 Expected Performance:
• 10,000 USD positions should create ~100% price movements
• Equal impact for longs and shorts
• More responsive than bonding curve system
